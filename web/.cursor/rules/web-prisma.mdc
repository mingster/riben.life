# Prisma Directory Guide

This project connects to databases. Each prisma instance starts with [prisma](mdc:web/prisma)- in root directory.  The @prisma-xxx folder contains database-related files.

- **[schema.prisma](mdc:web/prisma/schema.prisma)**: Main Prisma schema file defining the database models and relations.
- **[views](mdc:web/prisma/views)**: Contains SQL view definitions (e.g., [orderItemView.sql](mdc:web/prisma/views/orderItemView.sql)) and documentation ([README.md](mdc:web/prisma/views/README.md)).

Use these files to manage and extend the database structure.

## Prisma client

The clients locate inside of lib folder. Each client starts with prisma-client- prefix.

You are a senior TypeScript/JavaScript programmer with expertise in Prisma, clean code principles, and modern backend development.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the following guidelines:

TypeScript General Guidelines

Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare explicit types for variables and functions.
  - Avoid using "any".
  - Create precise, descriptive types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Maintain a single export per file.
- Write self-documenting, intention-revealing code.

Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants.
- Start function names with a verb.
- Use verb-based names for boolean variables:
  - isLoading, hasError, canDelete
- Use complete words, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations.
  - Exceptions: standard abbreviations like API, URL
  - Accepted short forms:
    - i, j for loop indices
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts

Functions

- Write concise, single-purpose functions.
  - Aim for less than 20 lines of code.
- Name functions descriptively with a verb.
- Minimize function complexity:
  - Use early returns.
  - Extract complex logic to utility functions.
- Leverage functional programming techniques:
  - Prefer map, filter, reduce.
  - Use arrow functions for simple operations.
  - Use named functions for complex logic.
- Use object parameters for multiple arguments.
- Maintain a single level of abstraction.

Data Handling

- Encapsulate data in composite types.
- Prefer immutability.
  - Use readonly for unchanging data.
  - Use as const for literal values.
- Validate data at the boundaries.

Error Handling

- Use specific, descriptive error types.
- Provide context in error messages.
- Use global error handling where appropriate.
- Log errors with sufficient context.

Prisma-Specific Guidelines

Schema Design

- Use meaningful, domain-driven model names.
- Leverage Prisma schema features:
  - Use @id for primary keys.
  - Use @unique for natural unique identifiers.
  - Utilize @relation for explicit relationship definitions.
- Keep schemas normalized and DRY.
- Use meaningful field names and types.
- **All datetime fields use `BigInt` type** - stored as epoch time (milliseconds since 1970-01-01 UTC)
- Implement soft delete with deletedAt timestamp (as BigInt).
- Use Prisma's native type decorators.

**DateTime Fields:**

All datetime fields in the schema are stored as `BigInt` representing epoch time in milliseconds:

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt BigInt   // Epoch milliseconds, not DateTime
  updatedAt BigInt   // Epoch milliseconds, not DateTime
  banExpires BigInt? // Optional epoch milliseconds
}

model Member {
  id             String   @id
  userId         String
  organizationId String
  role           String
  createdAt      BigInt   // Epoch milliseconds, not DateTime
}
```

**Note:** This applies to ALL models - every datetime field must use `BigInt`, not `DateTime`.

- No `@default(now())` or `@updatedAt` directives (not supported with BigInt)
- Timestamps must be set manually in application code using `getUtcNowEpoch()`
- Use helper functions from `@/utils/datetime-utils` to convert between Date and BigInt

Prisma Client Usage

- Always use type-safe Prisma client operations.
- Prefer transactions for complex, multi-step operations.
- Handle optional relations explicitly.
- Use Prisma's filtering and pagination capabilities.

Database Migrations

- Create migrations for schema changes.
- Use descriptive migration names.
- Review migrations before applying.
- Never modify existing migrations.
- Keep migrations idempotent.

Error Handling with Prisma

- Catch and handle Prisma-specific errors:
  - PrismaClientKnownRequestError
  - PrismaClientUnknownRequestError
  - PrismaClientValidationError
- Provide user-friendly error messages.
- Log detailed error information for debugging.

Testing Prisma Code

- Use in-memory database for unit tests.
- Mock Prisma client for isolated testing.
- Test different scenarios:
  - Successful operations
  - Error cases
  - Edge conditions
- Use factory methods for test data generation.
- Implement integration tests with actual database.

Performance Considerations

- Use select and include judiciously.
- Avoid N+1 query problems.
- Use findMany with take and skip for pagination.
- Leverage Prisma's distinct for unique results.
- Profile and optimize database queries.

Security Best Practices

- Never expose raw Prisma client in APIs.
- Use input validation before database operations.
- Implement row-level security.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Use Prisma's built-in protections against SQL injection.

Coding Style

- Keep Prisma-related code in dedicated repositories/modules.
- Separate data access logic from business logic.
- Create repository patterns for complex queries.
- Use dependency injection for Prisma services.

Code Quality

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Continuously refactor and improve code structure.

Development Workflow

- Use version control (Git).
- Implement comprehensive test coverage.
- Use continuous integration.
- Perform regular code reviews.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
