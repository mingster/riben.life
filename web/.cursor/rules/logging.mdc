# Logging

We use `logger` to do logging:

```typescript
import logger from "@/lib/logger";

const user = (await getUser()) as User;
logger.info(user);
```

Typically this will be added at the top of a file.
If we have a large function that reuses multiple variables we can do this within a function:

```typescript
import logger from "@/lib/logger";

// Can now call without passing userId:
logger.log("Created rule");
```

Don't use `.with()` for a global logger. Only use within a specific function.
