## How the Messaging API works

With the Messaging API, a bot server can send and receive data to and from the LINE Platform. Requests are sent over HTTPS in JSON. The communication flow between a bot server and the LINE Platform is as follows:

1. A user sends a message to a LINE Official Account.
1. The LINE Platform sends a webhook event to the webhook URL of the bot server.
1. The bot server checks the webhook event and responds to the user through the LINE Platform.
